# Many Values to Multiple Variables
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(x,y,z)

# One Value to Multiple Variables
# And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Unpack a Collection
# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc.
# Python allows you to extract the values into variables.This is called unpacking.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
